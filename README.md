# Automated-Cough-Detection
Course Project for **IEE-03 (Artificial Neural Networks and Applications)** (Open Elective). <br/>
The repository houses the code and data for our course project.<br/> We extracted features from raw audio files using MFCC spectrogram and used a CNN based classifier to distinguish the sound into Cough or normal Noise. <br/>
For detailed description of our project, refer to the blogpost
