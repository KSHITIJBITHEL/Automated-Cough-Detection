# Automated-Cough-Detection
Course Project for **IEE-03 (Artificial Neural Networks and Applications)**. <br/>
The repository houses the code and data for our course project. We extracted features from raw audio files using MFCC spectrogram and used a CNN based classifier to distinguish the sound into Cough or normal Noise. <br/>
For detailed description of our project, refer to the blogpost 
[Automated Cough Detection](https://kbithel.medium.com/audio-classification-for-cough-detection-11c1a9854d2b) <br/>
The Audio dataset (noise and cough) is available in the drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OvjddrYbrBUvUYFMbk7zHM0xPBny-twO?usp=sharing)
